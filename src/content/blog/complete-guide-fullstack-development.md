Risk assessment

Digital Security for Investigative Journalists and Human Rights Defenders in Censored and Threatening Environments. In a world where information has become a powerful resource, investigative journalists and human rights defenders in countries with strict censorship often face various digital and physical threats. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of threat models and digital security strategies that these professionals can adopt to protect their activities and sensitive information. However, before delving into the subject, it is crucial to understand the concept and origins of this topic, using the text from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) as a reference.

Assessing Risks The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s (EFF) approach to digital security emphasizes the importance of threat modeling. This involves answering five essential questions:

* What assets do I wish to protect?
* Whom do I wish to protect them against?
* What would be the severity of consequences in case of failure?
* What is the likelihood of needing to protect them?
* How far am I willing to go to avoid potential consequences?

This strategy aids in the precise identification of risks, allowing for the adoption of specific measures to protect what truly matters in the digital presence, making online security more accessible and understandable for everyone.

The full text from EFF is available at: https://ssd.eff.org/module/your-security-plan (It is highly recommended to read it before proceeding with the reading of our article. Note that in the EFF’s text, they refer to the physical environment for better understanding; it is up to you to adapt the concept to the digital environment, but in high-risk scenarios, you need to consider both the digital and physical worlds).

Based on this approach mentioned above, we will present an appropriate model for digital security, keeping in mind that there are at least three levels of threat, which I will now refer to as: Essential, Intermediate, and Advanced.
Time, Resources, and Knowledge: Three Critical Elements in Digital (and Physical)

Security In addition to the concept explained earlier, security adopts a fundamental principle that emphasizes the importance of three elements (directly related to your adversary) which, when combined, can inevitably result in the breach of your devices and even physical risk in some cases. These elements are Time, Resources, and Knowledge1.

We will incorporate these principles into the threat model discussed earlier and expand upon the EFF’s second question, “Whom do I wish to protect them against?” We will add the following question:

Which of the three elements does my adversary possess?

* 1. If the adversary possesses none of the elements, we can conclude that you face limited digital (and physical) risk. In this case, the application of common settings and procedures is sufficient to ensure your security against the adversary.

* 2. If the adversary possesses one or more of the three elements, but in a limited manner, you are likely to face significant risk, although it is not absolute. In this scenario, the implementation of intermediate settings, as long as rigorously followed, can provide adequate security and privacy.

* 3. Finally, if your adversary possesses all the elements in an unlimited manner, you are at high risk, and it is only a matter of time before your devices are compromised. It is crucial to note that, at this threat level, there may also be physical risks involved.

Now that we have established the importance of these elements, we can proceed with our text. As mentioned earlier, the article will be divided into three sections: Essential Security, Intermediate Security, and Advanced-Level Security.
Essential Security: Dealing with Common Adversaries

In the first approach, essential security starts with fundamental precautions. It is crucial for investigative journalists and human rights advocates to be aware of the following aspects:

Secure Operating Systems: Use up-to-date operating systems and always keep them updated with the latest security patches. Additionally, avoid using pirated operating systems, as the risks outweigh any savings. This culturally widespread practice should be abandoned. If you don’t want to pay for a Windows license, you can opt for free systems like Linux, which are generally more secure.

Protected Smartphones: Keep your smartphone’s operating system up to date, avoid installing suspicious apps, and encrypt your devices. Use strong passwords and avoid opening links or files from unknown senders. Remember that common sense is a valuable tool, and excessive curiosity can be exploited by adversaries.

Caution on Social Networks: Exercise caution on social networks by limiting personal information and configuring privacy settings for maximum control. Instruct friends and family not to share or tag you in photos, and avoid revealing your real-time location. Decline invitations from unknown people and trust your instincts.

Secure Passwords: Adopt complex and unique passwords for each account, and consider two-factor authentication (2FA3) whenever possible. Statistics indicate that most passwords are weak, including obvious choices like important dates, family names, and easily discoverable information by adversaries without substantial resources. Therefore, choosing strong passwords is essential for your online security. Common sense remains your best ally in this regard.

Note: You might wonder what elements can ensure your security at an essential level, but believe me, if you follow the tips mentioned above correctly, practically everything will be “secure.” Let me explain how: All your activities in the digital world are carried out through an Operating System, whether on a Smartphone or a Computer/Notebook. The precautions suggested for social networks are also applicable to emails, data sharing, and avoiding clicking on suspicious links, among others. Furthermore, considering that passwords are an inevitable part of almost all online interactions involving registrations, following password tips provides an additional layer of protection. Do you agree? Please share your opinion on this in the comments section at the end of the text.
Intermediate Threats: Limited Resources

If you’ve identified that your adversary possesses at least one or two of the essential elements but in a limited manner, you’re dealing with an intermediate threat. In this scenario, it’s crucial to adopt more advanced practices compared to the previous tips.

Note: At this threat level, you will still apply the essential tips but will apply some additional precautions, which are as follows:

Assessment of Digital Risks: Conduct regular assessments of digital risks associated with your devices to identify suspicious activities. The Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN) collaborated with experts from the Ford Foundation to adapt the Ford Cybersecurity Assessment Tool (CAT) for use in investigative journalism groups. We recommend its use, and you can find it here: Journalist Security Assessment Tool (JSAT).

Note: If you identify a physical risk, at an advanced level, we will present tips for physical security.

VPNs for Privacy: Use a virtual private network (VPN4) to mask your online traffic. A VPN helps protect your data from prying eyes, such as internet service providers (ISPs5), local governments, and companies looking to monitor your internet activities. Moreover, many countries have laws stipulating a minimum browsing history retention period, making a VPN essential for maintaining your privacy. A useful analogy is to imagine the internet connection as passing a paper through a hose in a pool without getting it wet; the VPN creates a tunnel, allowing your data to pass without being exposed to the water.

It’s important to note that some VPNs are more privacy-focused than others, so research and read reviews before choosing a service. Remember that often, “when the product is free, you are the product.

Protecting Sensitive Materials: If you are an investigative journalist, you may be dealing with sensitive information that is of great interest to your adversary. This may include incriminating evidence, names of confidential sources, addresses, and other critical data. It is your responsibility to protect them at all costs, as negligence can result in serious consequences, even for your sources. Store sensitive data with strong encryption and consider secure sharing methods. Now that your threat level is intermediate, it is crucial to adopt strong passwords (we recommend at least 64 characters) and use a password manager.

Disaster Prevention Plans: Maintain secure backups of your most important data and documents. This is essential to prevent catastrophic losses in the event of a hacker intrusion or accidental incidents. After all, you wouldn’t want to lose everything, including your job.

Secure Instant Messaging Apps: While WhatsApp claims to use end-to-end encryption, concerns about metadata2 persist due to Meta’s business model. This could provide information to your adversaries, especially if you are a target of governments seeking information through legal requests. Apps like Signal or Session, which offer end-to-end encryption and do not collect metadata, are more secure alternatives.

Doxxing: A Constant Threat: The practice of revealing personal information online is a growing threat to investigative journalists. Be aware of how adversaries can use doxxing6 to harm you and take preventive measures, such as limiting the disclosure of personal information or even applying doxxing techniques to yourself to identify and remove sensitive information.
Advanced-Level Threats: Unlimited Resources

When you identify that your adversary has unlimited resources, such as abundant time, financial resources, and knowledge, it is essential to be prepared. It’s important to note that at this level, your chances of protecting yourself are limited because your adversary has access to virtually infinite time, knowledge, and resources.

In this scenario, your best option is to become “invisible” in the crowd by seeking anonymity. The more you can blend in and remain incognito, the harder it will be for your adversary to locate you. Additionally, investing in digital security knowledge is an additional guarantee because the more you know, the more secure you can be.

However, this level of threat is quite complex and requires significant effort and dedication from the journalist or anyone at a high threat level. For this reason, we will not continue writing as we did in the previous chapters.

Nevertheless, we will show the main aspects of advanced-level digital security. These include:

* Disk Encryption
* Host Operating System
* Virtual Machines
* Anonymous Networks
* Anonymous Browsers
* Metadata Management
* Dealing with Malware
* Cryptocurrencies and the Dark Web
* SecureDrop
* Globaleaks
* OnionShare
* Haven App
* Others…

NOTE: In the advanced module, you will find comprehensive and self-explanatory texts so that you can protect yourself in case you find yourself at this level.
Conclusion

In the journey towards digital security, it is crucial to understand that our threats vary in complexity and intensity.

We start with the threat model, identifying what we want to protect, who we want to protect ourselves from, and the potential consequences. We then adapt our security level based on this model, dividing it into three layers: Essential, Intermediate, and Advanced.

In essential security, we establish a solid foundation by adopting practices such as using strong passwords and secure operating systems. For intermediate threats, we escalate our defenses by incorporating VPNs, data encryption, and advanced secure sharing techniques.

Finally, when facing adversaries with unlimited resources, we explore anonymity, advanced encryption, and advanced security tools, aware that privacy is one of the best defenses.

Always remembering that knowledge is our greatest weapon. Therefore, regardless of the threat level, educating oneself about digital security is essential. Through this understanding and appropriate measures, we can protect our online presence, keeping our personal and sensitive information out of the reach of digital threats. Navigating with confidence in the digital age is a challenge, but with the right knowledge and careful actions, it is a challenge we can overcome.

List of Terms

1. Time, Resources, and Knowledge: Widely recognized premise in the field of digital security that no system is entirely invasion-proof when faced with an adversary who possesses time, financial resources, and technical knowledge. This means that even the most robust security measures can be overcome by determined attackers willing to invest time and effort to discover vulnerabilities and exploit them. Therefore, investigative journalists, especially at the advanced threat level, should be aware that cybersecurity is a constant challenge and should adopt strict data protection and communication practices to mitigate risks.

2. Metadata: Used in digital security to track the origin, destination, and behavior of data and communications, aiding in the detection of cyber threats. However, they can be detrimental to privacy, as they reveal sensitive information such as location, communication history, and usage patterns, which can be exploited by third parties without consent, posing a threat to the privacy and security of investigative journalists.

3. 2FA: (Two-Factor Authentication) is a security method that requires two different forms of verification, typically something the user knows (like a password) and something the user possesses (like a smartphone), to access accounts or systems.

4. VPN: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that establishes a secure internet connection, allowing data to be transmitted in an encrypted and protected manner, ensuring the privacy and security of online communications.

5. ISPs (Internet Service Providers) are companies or organizations that provide internet access to users, enabling device connection and web browsing, typically through telecommunications networks.

6. Doxxing: The practice of researching and disclosing personal and private information, such as name, address, phone number, email address, and other sensitive information about a person on the internet without their consent. This is usually done with the intention of exposing, embarrassing, intimidating, or harming the target individual.

The term “doxxing” is a combination of the words “documents” and “dropping” and is often used in negative contexts, as it violates privacy and can have serious consequences for the security and well-being of the exposed person.
NOTE:

This article is just the starting point (in the table next to this, you will see it identified as: ‘Art. 01 — Threat Model’).

As recently observed, investigative journalists and human rights advocates are facing increasingly significant challenges in high-censorship environments, with governments and small groups of mercenary hackers conducting large-scale espionage.

Continuous pursuit of education and adherence to recommended digital security practices are essential to safeguarding your mission and fundamental principles.
